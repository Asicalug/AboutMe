                    I've been a Staff member for their discord server since 2023 and I've really enjoyed my time there. I helped multiple users to run this software. I was very surprised when i heard that Lunar send a c&d letter to the owners. I first thought that this was some sort of joke and i wished it was.

                This software was a tool to<br>
                modify the popular Minecraft PvP client,<br>
                Lunar Client.<br>
                It has sadly been Cease & Desist by<br>
                the owners of Lunar Client.<br>
                This tool had a big impact on the Cracked<br>
                community because it could allow cracked<br>
                account users to use it. <br>
                <br>
                The client will sadly never return.
